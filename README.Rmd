## Conklin, Lisovski & Battley 2021 - Environmental data and analysis

In Arctic-breeding shorebirds, timing of breeding closely follows the retreat of snow-cover from tundra nest sites in the spring. We compared two indices of breeding phenology (timing of
snowmelt and spring ‘green-up’), summarized separately for two regions (North, South) of the Alaska breeding range (Figure 1) of bar-tailed godwits. We did this for two temporal periods: long-term trends encompassing the entire study period (2008–2020), and a shorter term related directly to the period in which we tracked individuals with geolocators (2008–2014).
