## Conklin, Lisovski & Battley 2021 - Environmental data and analysis

In Arctic-breeding shorebirds, timing of breeding closely follows the
retreat of snow-cover from tundra nest sites in the spring. We compared
two indices of breeding phenology (timing of snowmelt and spring
‘green-up’), summarized separately for two regions (North, South) of
the Alaska breeding range (Figure 1) of bar-tailed godwits. We did this
for two temporal periods: long-term trends encompassing the entire study
period (2008–2020), and a shorter term related directly to the period in
which we tracked individuals with geolocators (2008–2014).
